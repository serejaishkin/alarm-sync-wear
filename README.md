## Download

**Latest signed APK** - [Releases page](https://github.com/serejaishkin/alarm-sync-wear/releases/latest)

```
adb install AlarmClockXtreme-v1.15.33-play-release.apk
```

The Play-flavor APK includes the YouTube alarm-sound downloader (yt-dlp + NewPipe Extractor), Wear OS Data Layer bridge, Wear next-alarm tile/complication support, optional Health Connect READ_SLEEP integration, and ML Kit Digital Ink handwriting recognition. The F-Droid flavor strips proprietary or Play-distribution-adjacent phone pieces for an unencumbered build.

## Roadmap

### Done
- Phone ↔ Watch alarm sync via Wear OS Data Layer (CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE / ENABLE / DISABLE / SNOOZE / DISMISS)
- Authoritative DELETE — deletions always win, no more alarm resurrection via snapshots
- Watch alarm firing no longer triggers phone media playback (RINGING is watch-local only)
- Sync provenance display — "Changed on watch/phone at HH:mm" on both phone and watch lists
- Dark blue theme ported from phone to Wear OS UI (list, editor, firing screen)
- New bell icon replacing old clock face (adaptive + monochrome + legacy PNGs)
- Cold-start jank fix — sync provenance reads moved off main thread

### In Progress
- Diagnosing Data Layer delivery failures (transport logging added, awaiting user logcat)
- Cold-start optimization — WorkManager lazy init, Hilt DI cascade, SharedPreferences I/O on main thread remain

### Backlog
- BLE transport fallback for devices without Google Play Services
- Full phone → watch snapshot reconciliation on reconnect
- Watch → phone: proper tombstone cleanup after echo-DELETE
- Localization — replace hardcoded Russian strings in wear module with resource strings
- Wear OS Compose migration (current UI is programmatic Views)
- F-Droid flavor: stub-less direct sync path (currently no-op)
- Signed release builds, CI/CD, Play Store / F-Droid submission

## Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serejaishkin/alarm-sync-wear.git
cd alarm-sync-wear
./gradlew assemblePlayDebug

## Configuration

### Signing

1. Generate a keystore: `keytool -genkey -v -keystore release.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias alarm`
2. Copy `keystore.properties.template` to `keystore.properties`
3. Fill in your keystore path and credentials
4. Build: `./gradlew :app:bundlePlayRelease :app:assemblePlayRelease :app:verifyFdroidReleaseSize :wear:assembleRelease`

Local release builds use `keystore.properties`. If you mirror this setup in
another environment, use either the preferred `ANDROID_*` names or the legacy
short names for the same values:

| Preferred secret | Legacy alias | Purpose |
|------------------|--------------|---------|
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_BASE64` | `KEYSTORE_BASE64` | Base64-encoded release keystore |
| `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` | Keystore password |
| `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS` | `KEY_ALIAS` | Signing key alias |
| `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD` | `KEY_PASSWORD` | Signing key password |

Release artifact tasks depend on the root `verifyReleaseSigning` check and fail
closed when `keystore.properties` or its configured keystore is missing. This
prevents an unsigned AAB or APK from being mistaken for a publishable artifact.
Release builds produce signed Play, F-Droid, and Wear APKs locally; the F-Droid
size check also builds its release APK and enforces the 40 MiB budget. The Play
bundle is written under `app/build/outputs/bundle/playRelease/`. Verify
signatures with `apksigner`, write `SHA256SUMS.txt` and
`APK-CERT-FINGERPRINTS.txt`, and attach the artifacts to the GitHub Release.

To verify a sideloaded APK's signing certificate:

```bash
apksigner verify --print-certs AlarmClockXtreme-v1.15.33-play-release.apk
```

Compare the `certificate SHA-256 digest` against the fingerprint published in
the release's `APK-CERT-FINGERPRINTS.txt`.

Before a local release, run:

```bash
bash scripts/check-signing-hygiene.sh
./gradlew verifyReleaseMetadata
./gradlew verifyDependencyIntegrity
./gradlew :app:verifyRoomSchemaExports
python scripts/osv_gradle_audit.py
python scripts/verify_api37_release.py --device <api37-16kb-serial> --run-test-alarm --fresh-install
```

Dependency artifacts are SHA-256 verified and the Play, F-Droid, and Wear
release runtime graphs are locked. When intentionally updating dependencies,
refresh both controls and review every checksum/version diff before committing:

```powershell
.\scripts\update-dependency-integrity.ps1
```

The signing check fails if keystore files or `keystore.properties` are
tracked/staged, or if common signing-material paths are not ignored. The OSV
gate resolves Play, F-Droid, and Wear release runtime classpaths and exits
non-zero on reported vulnerabilities. The Android 17 verifier checks 16 KB APK
alignment for Play, F-Droid, and Wear release APKs, installs the Play release
on an API 37 16 KB device, verifies exact-alarm, promoted-notification,
notification, and local-network permission state, and can drive the built-in
test alarm.

## Privacy

No analytics. No ads. No tracking. No accounts. No data leaves your device except:
- Weather, air-quality, geocoding, and pollen calls to Open-Meteo for your selected location
- Active-alerts calls to api.weather.gov / NWS for US weather-alert coverage
- Holiday API calls to Nager.Date for the selected country
- Live radar embed from Windy.com on the Weather tab; Windy's privacy policy applies inside the embed
- News RSS calls to your configured feed source, including Google News, BBC, NPR, Hacker News, or a custom URL
- Webhook calls to your configured HTTPS URL, including alarm event metadata. Payloads include `schemaVersion`, `event`, `eventId`, `occurredAt`, `alarmId`, `scheduledFor`, `displayTime`, and `labelIncluded`; alarm labels are included only when the Settings toggle is on.
- Google Routes transit ETA calls for commute-aware calendar auto-alarms only when you enable the feature and provide your own Routes API key; event locations and saved origin coordinates are sent for that lookup.
- Internet radio streaming to your configured station
- Philips Hue commands to your configured bridge on your local network
- ML Kit Digital Ink model download in the Play flavor when you first use handwriting recognition; recognition runs on-device after the model is available
- YouTube search, preview, stream resolution, and download requests in the Play flavor only; F-Droid excludes this feature

Play-flavor Health Connect support is opt-in and requests only `android.permission.health.READ_SLEEP`. Recent sleep-session summaries are used locally in Bedtime and Statistics, including sleep/wake trend charts; they are not copied into Room/DataStore/backups and are never uploaded to the developer. Smart-alarm actigraphy stores only compact local motion-bucket summaries for 30 days; raw accelerometer samples are not retained and the buckets are not medical sleep-stage records. Sonar sleep tracking is manually started from Bedtime, uses the microphone only while its foreground notification is active, stores compact movement/restless/still summaries plus loud sleep-sound event metadata locally for 30 days, and does not retain raw audio. Pre-sleep factor tags store only the selected caffeine/exercise/alcohol/stress flags and local date for 30 days, then compare tagged nights against local Sonar/smart-wake restlessness summaries on device. Chronotype estimates store only five local preference answers and derive a bedtime/wake target on device. Jet-lag planner settings store only target wake time, adjustment days, and direction on device. Bedtime room-noise baselines use the microphone only at reminder time when permission is granted, keep only a quiet/moderate/loud label plus timestamp, exclude that label from backup and device transfer, and do not save raw audio. Weather and news keep one compact last-good cache file each for offline display; these caches stay in app files storage and are excluded from manual backups, system backup includes, and support bundles. Support bundles are created only when you choose to export them and include redacted wake-readiness, test-alarm proof timing, aggregate smart-wake decision metadata, and recent alarm incident event codes, not labels, pre-sleep tag rows, snore-event rows, or per-minute motion/audio buckets. Crash logs are capped local files in app-private storage, excluded from backups, and never uploaded automatically; they leave the device only if you explicitly export a support bundle. Plain JSON backups and share links are created only when you choose to export or share, and may contain alarm labels, schedules, settings, integration URLs, webhook URLs, Hue configuration, selected firing background image URIs, chronotype answers, and jet-lag planner settings. Backup import previews read the selected file first and do not write alarms or settings until you choose Append or Replace.

Settings can hide alarm and timer labels on public surfaces. When enabled, alarm notifications, finished-timer notifications, missed-alarm prompts, wake-confirm prompts, the home widget, the quick settings tile, and Play-flavor Wear next-alarm snapshots use neutral text while labels remain visible in private notification content and inside the unlocked app.

Android system Auto Backup is deliberately narrower than manual export. On Android 12+, cloud backup includes the Room alarm database (schedules, labels, challenge configs, and local pre-sleep tags) but excludes DataStore preferences, which contain webhook URLs, Hue API keys, guardian contacts, and custom feed URLs. Device-transfer (same-device or direct migration) includes DataStore so those settings survive a local upgrade. On Android 8-11, legacy cloud backup includes only DataStore preferences. Crash logs, support bundles, downloaded media, and challenge reference files are excluded from all backup paths. After a cloud restore, enabled alarms are automatically re-armed via a restore agent.

## Webhook Integration Recipes

ACX sends an HTTPS POST with a JSON payload on alarm lifecycle events. Enable webhooks in Settings > Integrations > Webhooks and enter your HTTPS endpoint URL.

**Payload schema (v1):**

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "event": "alarm_fired",
  "eventId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "occurredAt": "2026-06-13T07:00:00Z",
  "alarmId": 42,
  "scheduledFor": "2026-06-13T07:00:00Z",
  "displayTime": "7:00 AM",
  "labelIncluded": true,
  "label": "Work alarm",
  "fireId": "42-1718258400000"
}
```

Events: `alarm_fired`, `alarm_snoozed`, `alarm_dismissed`, `alarm_missed`, `alarm_skipped`, `test`. The `label` field is present only when `labelIncluded` is `true` (controlled by Settings > Webhooks > Include alarm labels). `fireId` is present when available.

When Settings > Webhooks > Signing secret is set, ACX adds:

- `X-ACX-Timestamp`: Unix epoch seconds at send time.
- `X-ACX-Signature`: `v1=<hmac-sha256>` over `timestamp + "." + raw_json_body`.

Reject signed payloads whose timestamp differs from receiver time by more than five minutes. Settings also shows the most recent webhook delivery result so failed automations can be diagnosed without blocking alarm dismissal.

Delivery is asynchronous and never blocks alarm UI or dismissal. The initial request uses a five-second connect/read timeout. `alarm_fired` and `alarm_missed` retry up to three times through WorkManager when the first request fails, with approximately 30-, 60-, and 120-second exponential backoff; `eventId` and `occurredAt` remain unchanged so receivers can deduplicate. Snooze, dismiss, skip, and test events are best-effort single attempts. A successful HTTP 2xx-3xx response is recorded as delivered; a non-2xx response or transport error is recorded in the recent-delivery log.

### Home Assistant

Create a webhook automation in your `automations.yaml`:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "ACX alarm fired — turn on lights"
    trigger:
      - platform: webhook
        webhook_id: "your-secret-random-id-here"
        allowed_methods:
          - POST
        local_only: true
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ trigger.json.event == 'alarm_fired' }}"
    action:
      - service: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.bedroom
        data:
          brightness_pct: 80
          color_temp_kelvin: 3000
```

In ACX Settings, enter `https://your-ha-host:8123/api/webhook/your-secret-random-id-here`. Generate a unique random `webhook_id` (e.g., `uuidgen` or `python -c "import uuid; print(uuid.uuid4())"`) — do not reuse example values. Home Assistant webhook triggers do not require an API token when `local_only: true`.

### Tasker

ACX requires HTTPS endpoints. For local Tasker automation, set up a local HTTPS bridge:

1. Install the **Tasker** app and the **AutoRemote** plugin (or another HTTPS-capable receiver).
2. In Tasker, create a Profile > Event > Plugin > AutoRemote > Message Filter = `acx_alarm`.
3. In ACX Settings, enter your AutoRemote personal HTTPS URL.
4. Create a Tasker Task linked to the profile with your desired actions (e.g., enable Wi-Fi, launch music app, set display brightness).

Alternatively, if your network supports it, use a Tasker HTTP Server plugin with a self-signed certificate and configure ACX to POST to `https://your-phone-ip:port/alarm`.

### MacroDroid

1. In MacroDroid, create a Macro with trigger **Webhook (URL)**.
2. Copy the generated HTTPS webhook URL (MacroDroid provides one per macro via cloud relay; requires Play Services).
3. Paste the URL into ACX Settings > Webhooks.
4. In the macro action, use **Set Variable** to capture `{webhook_body}`, then parse with `JSONPath` expressions:
   - Event: `$.event`
   - Alarm ID: `$.alarmId`
   - Display time: `$.displayTime`
5. Add a **Condition** checking the variable against your target event (e.g., `alarm_fired`).

Note: MacroDroid's saved webhook body limit is ~3800 characters. ACX payloads are well under this limit.

## FAQ

**How does the YouTube alarm-sound downloader work?**
On the Alarms tab tap "Download alarm sound from YouTube." A dialog opens with two modes: search YouTube directly (powered by NewPipe Extractor) or paste a video URL. Each result has a play/stop button to preview the audio before committing. Tap the row to download; yt-dlp resolves the best-audio stream with a fixed `--get-url` option allow-list, OkHttp streams it to your alarm library via MediaStore (`IS_ALARM=1`), and the ringtone picker re-enumerates so the new sound is immediately selectable. The Play flavor also includes a manual "Update" action for the local yt-dlp engine; ACX never updates it in the background, and a failed update keeps the existing engine in place. F-Droid builds ship without this feature for licensing reasons.

**Why does the alarm not fire on my Xiaomi/Samsung/Huawei?**
These manufacturers aggressively kill background apps. The app shows a manufacturer-specific warning during onboarding with steps to whitelist it. Generally: Settings > Battery > App Launch > AlarmClockXtreme > Manual > enable all toggles.

**Why does the weather show the wrong temperature?**
Check Settings > Dashboard > Temperature unit. The app defaults to Fahrenheit. You can also set a manual location if GPS isn't available.

**Can I use this without Google Play Services?**
Yes. Core alarm features do not require Google Play Services. Weather uses Open-Meteo, Nager.Date, and api.weather.gov depending on enabled features. The F-Droid build variant excludes Play-specific code, including the YouTube downloader, Wear OS Data Layer bridge, Health Connect SDK path, and ML Kit handwriting recognizer; the handwriting challenge still has a typed fallback.

**How does Mission Chaining work?**
In alarm edit, set the "Challenge chain" field to a comma-separated list of challenge types (e.g., `MATH_EASY,SHAKE,TYPING`). The alarm will require you to solve each challenge in order before dismissing.

**What is Guardian Angel?**
If enabled on an alarm, and you don't dismiss within the configured delay (default 5 minutes), the app escalates to your emergency contact. F-Droid builds can auto-send the emergency SMS when you grant `SEND_SMS`, then open the call path. Play builds do not request `SEND_SMS`; they open a prefilled SMS composer and fall back to call or dialer if texting cannot open. `CALL_PHONE` is optional because the app can always fall back to the dialer. Settings > Wake readiness shows active Guardian alarms, the current SMS/call path, and direct recovery actions for missing SMS or call permission.
