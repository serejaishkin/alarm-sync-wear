/**
 * Pure decision function for the proactive fire watchdog.
 *
 * A watchdog check is enqueued [WATCHDOG_DELAY_MS] after every scheduled alarm
 * fire. When it runs it asks: did AlarmManager actually deliver this fire? The
 * only writer of a `BROADCAST` incident is `AlarmReceiver`, and only on real
 * delivery, so a zero broadcast count means the alarm was silently suppressed
 * (the Pixel "missed alarm — unknown reason" / OEM-Doze failure class). In that
 * case — and only then — the alarm is re-fired.
 *
 * Extracted from [FireWatchdogWorker] so the guards can be unit-tested without
 * WorkManager / Hilt / a real foreground service. The worker holds no other
 * policy; it just dispatches the side effect this returns.
